>> Create Node js server

Dear chatGPt, I am using replit to create simple server. In Replit, I have selected node.js template, therefore please provide me with the information relevant to my template in Replit. Now, please generate a simple node.js server using Express that responds with 'Hello from the server!" when someone visits the homepages.


>> summary from chatGPT

Hereâ€™s a Replit-ready Node.js + Express server that will respond with
Hello from the server! when someone visits the homepage (/).


Add the current date and time in webpage 

>> Dear chatgpt, thanks for sharing the code. Please generate a node.js route using Express that responds with the current date and time in a human-readable format.

// index.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from the server!");
});

// Route for current date and time
app.get("/datetime", (req, res) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const formattedDate = now.toLocaleString("en-US", {
    weekday: "long",
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    hour: "numeric",
    minute: "numeric",
    second: "numeric",
    hour12: true,
  });
  res.send(`Current date and time: ${formattedDate}`);
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
